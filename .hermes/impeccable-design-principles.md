## audit.md
Run systematic **technical** quality checks and generate a comprehensive report. Don't fix issues; document them for other commands to address.

This is a code-level audit, not a design critique. Check what's measurable and verifiable in the implementation.

**Web only.** Native platforms (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`) route to [audit.native.md](audit.native.md) instead; if the project is native, switch to it now.

## Diagnostic Scan

Run comprehensive checks across 5 dimensions. Score each dimension 0-4 using the criteria below.

### 1. Accessibility (A11y)

**Check for**:
- **Contrast issues**: Text contrast ratios < 4.5:1 (or 7:1 for AAA)
- **Motion sensitivity**: `prefers-reduced-motion` needs an intentional alternative that preserves state change and hierarchy; flag a global `0.01ms` kill that destroys useful feedback, flashing above threshold, and motion that blocks focus, reading, or task completion
- **Missing ARIA**: Interactive elements without proper roles, labels, or states
- **Keyboard navigation**: Missing focus indicators, illogical tab order, keyboard traps
- **Semantic HTML**: Improper heading hierarchy, missing landmarks, divs instead of buttons
- **Alt text**: Missing or poor image descriptions
- **Form issues**: Inputs without labels, poor error messaging, missing required indicators

**Score 0-4**: 0=Inaccessible (fails WCAG A), 1=Major gaps (few ARIA labels, no keyboard nav), 2=Partial (some a11y effort, significant gaps), 3=Good (WCAG AA mostly met, minor gaps), 4=Excellent (WCAG AA fully met, approaches AAA)

### 2. Performance

**Check for**:
- **Layout thrashing**: Reading/writing layout properties in loops
- **Expensive animations**: Casual layout-property animation, unbounded blur/filter/shadow effects, or effects that visibly drop frames
- **Missing optimization**: Images without lazy loading, unoptimized assets
- **will-change overuse**: `will-change` applied broadly or left on at rest (it is a targeted hint for known expensive animations, not a baseline requirement)
- **Bundle size**: Unnecessary imports, unused dependencies
- **Render performance**: Unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization

**Score 0-4**: 0=Severe issues (layout thrash, unoptimized everything), 1=Major problems (no lazy loading, expensive animations), 2=Partial (some optimization, gaps remain), 3=Good (mostly optimized, minor improvements possible), 4=Excellent (fast, lean, well-optimized)

### 3. Theming

**Check for**:
- **Hard-coded colors**: Colors not using design tokens
- **Broken dark mode**: Missing dark mode variants, poor contrast in dark theme
- **Inconsistent tokens**: Using wrong tokens, mixing token types
- **Theme switching issues**: Values that don't update on theme change

**Score 0-4**: 0=No theming (hard-coded everything), 1=Minimal tokens (mostly hard-coded), 2=Partial (tokens exist but inconsistently used), 3=Good (tokens used, minor hard-coded values), 4=Excellent (full token system, dark mode works perfectly)

### 4. Responsive Design

**Check for**:
- **Fixed widths**: Hard-coded widths that break on mobile
- **Touch targets**: Interactive elements < 44x44px
- **Horizontal scroll**: Content overflow on narrow viewports
- **Text scaling**: Layouts that break when text size increases
- **Missing breakpoints**: No mobile/tablet variants

**Score 0-4**: 0=Desktop-only (breaks on mobile), 1=Major issues (some breakpoints, many failures), 2=Partial (works on mobile, rough edges), 3=Good (responsive, minor touch target or overflow issues), 4=Excellent (fluid, all viewports, proper touch targets)

### 5. Implementation Integrity (CRITICAL)

Run the bundled detector and verify each finding in context. Look for repeated implementation shortcuts, design-system drift, misleading or decorative content, and structure that is interchangeable with an unrelated product. Keep deterministic findings separate from visual judgment and call out false positives.

**Score 0-4**: 0=systemic drift, 1=major repeated failures, 2=several verified issues, 3=minor isolated issues, 4=coherent and intentional

## Generate Report

### Audit Health Score

| # | Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|---|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | ? | [most critical a11y issue or "--"] |
| 2 | Performance | ? | |
| 3 | Responsive Design | ? | |
| 4 | Theming | ? | |
| 5 | Implementation Integrity | ? | |
| **Total** | | **??/20** | **[Rating band]** |

**Rating bands**: 18-20 Excellent (minor polish), 14-17 Good (address weak dimensions), 10-13 Acceptable (significant work needed), 6-9 Poor (major overhaul), 0-5 Critical (fundamental issues)

### Implementation Integrity Verdict
**Start here.** Pass/fail: does the implementation express a coherent product-specific system? Cite verified evidence and detector findings.

### Executive Summary
- Audit Health Score: **??/20** ([rating band])
- Total issues found (count by severity: P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Top 3-5 critical issues
- Recommended next steps

### Detailed Findings by Severity

Tag every issue with **P0-P3 severity**:
- **P0 Blocking**: Prevents task completion. Fix immediately
- **P1 Major**: Significant difficulty or WCAG AA violation. Fix before release
- **P2 Minor**: Annoyance, workaround exists. Fix in next pass
- **P3 Polish**: Nice-to-fix, no real user impact. Fix if time permits

For each issue, document:
- **[P?] Issue name**
- **Location**: Component, file, line
- **Category**: Accessibility / Performance / Theming / Responsive / Implementation Integrity
- **Impact**: How it affects users
- **WCAG/Standard**: Which standard it violates (if applicable)
- **Recommendation**: How to fix it
- **Suggested command**: Which command to use (prefer: /impeccable adapt, /impeccable animate, /impeccable audit, /impeccable bolder, /impeccable clarify, /impeccable colorize, /impeccable critique, /impeccable delight, /impeccable distill, /impeccable document, /impeccable harden, /impeccable layout, /impeccable onboard, /impeccable optimize, /impeccable overdrive, /impeccable polish, /impeccable quieter, /impeccable shape, /impeccable typeset)

### Patterns & Systemic Issues

Identify recurring problems that indicate systemic gaps rather than one-off mistakes:
- "Hard-coded colors appear in 15+ components, should use design tokens"
- "Touch targets consistently too small (<44px) throughout mobile experience"

### Positive Findings

Note what's working well: good practices to maintain and replicate.

## Recommended Actions

List recommended commands in priority order (P0 first, then P1, then P2):

1. **[P?] `/command-name`**: Brief description (specific context from audit findings)
2. **[P?] `/command-name`**: Brief description (specific context)

**Rules**: Only recommend commands from: /impeccable adapt, /impeccable animate, /impeccable audit, /impeccable bolder, /impeccable clarify, /impeccable colorize, /impeccable critique, /impeccable delight, /impeccable distill, /impeccable document, /impeccable harden, /impeccable layout, /impeccable onboard, /impeccable optimize, /impeccable overdrive, /impeccable polish, /impeccable quieter, /impeccable shape, /impeccable typeset. Map findings to the most appropriate command. End with `/impeccable polish` as the final step if any fixes were recommended.

After presenting the summary, tell the user:

> You can ask me to run these one at a time, all at once, or in any order you prefer.
>
> Re-run `/impeccable audit` after fixes to see your score improve.

**IMPORTANT**: Be thorough but actionable. Too many P3 issues creates noise. Focus on what actually matters.

**NEVER**:
- Report issues without explaining impact (why does this matter?)
- Provide generic recommendations (be specific and actionable)
- Skip positive findings (celebrate what works)
- Forget to prioritize (everything can't be P0)
- Report false positives without verification

## craft.md
# Craft (deprecated alias)

`craft` is a deprecated alias for an ordinary request to make new visual work. It adds no setup, interview, checkpoint, tool, or quality behavior. Apply SKILL.md's normal routing: create missing PRODUCT.md through [init.md](init.md), then follow [new-work.md](new-work.md) for visual authority, world and surface decisions, implementation, and finish.

Do not tell users they need to invoke `craft`. Natural requests such as “build this feature,” “make a landing page,” or “redesign this screen” use the same flow.

---

## colorize.md
> **Additional context needed**: existing brand colors.

Introduce color as hierarchy, meaning, and atmosphere. Preserve confirmed brand and semantic conventions; do not replace a visual world under the guise of colorizing it.

---

## Visitor mode

- **Persuade + Experience:** color may carry the voice and own large regions when the selected world calls for it.
- **Operate + Read:** color primarily encodes action, selection, status, wayfinding, and reading hierarchy. Rarity gives an accent force.

## Audit before choosing

Read DESIGN.md, tokens, assets, current themes, and representative states. Identify:

- which colors are confirmed brand commitments;
- current surface, text, action, and semantic roles;
- places where grayscale obscures hierarchy or state;
- contrast failures and color-only communication;
- light/dark or data-visualization requirements;
- whether the task asks for more color or a new identity.

If a new identity is required, use [new-work.md](new-work.md). Ask only when a binding brand decision cannot be inferred.

## Choose a strategy

Name the intended emotional temperature, dominant relationship, contrast range, and color dosage before editing. The strategy may be restrained or immersive; it must follow the brief and selected world rather than a fixed percentage rule.

Build roles, not a bag of swatches:

- canvas and elevated surfaces;
- primary and secondary text;
- action, focus, and selection;
- borders and separators;
- success, warning, error, and information;
- data categories or scales when needed.

Use the project's existing color space. For a new web palette, prefer OKLCH because lightness and chroma can be adjusted predictably. Choose hue from product meaning and visual direction, never from a default category association.

## Apply at system scale

- Let the strongest color own a deliberate region or role instead of scattering tiny accents.
- Keep the primary action easy to find; do not spend its color on decoration.
- Tint neutrals only when the brand hue genuinely creates cohesion. Neutral gray is valid when it serves the world.
- On colored surfaces, derive secondary text from the foreground or surface hue rather than using washed-out generic gray.
- Keep semantic meanings consistent, but respect platform and domain conventions instead of assuming fixed hues.
- For data, use distinct lightness, chroma, shape, label, or pattern so color is not the only code.
- In dark mode, design surface elevation and contrast explicitly; do not invert the light theme mechanically.
- Define primitive values and semantic tokens when the project has a token system. Theme changes should normally remap semantic roles.

Decoration without a relationship to hierarchy, state, content, or the visual world is not a color strategy.

## Contrast and perception

Verify computed foreground/background pairs:

| Content | WCAG AA minimum |
|---|---|
| body text | 4.5:1 |
| large text | 3:1 |
| controls, icons, focus indicators | 3:1 |

Do not rely on eyesight alone. Check interactive states, overlays, text on images, disabled content, and both themes. Simulate common vision deficiencies. Information conveyed by color also needs text, shape, iconography, or position.

When deriving OKLCH ramps, vary lightness and reduce chroma near white and black. Do not keep high chroma at extreme lightness merely to make the math uniform. Prefer explicit colors over chains of translucent overlays when alpha would make contrast context-dependent.

## Verify

- Every color has a stable role or a world-specific atmospheric purpose.
- Attention lands on the intended action, content, or state.
- The palette works across quiet, dense, interactive, error, and empty states.
- Light and dark themes are each composed, not mechanically inverted.
- Contrast and non-color cues pass in all relevant states.
- The result is recognizably this product, not a generic “colorful” treatment.

When the palette earns its place, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## Live-mode signature params

When invoked from live mode, every variant declares a `color-amount` parameter. Author CSS against `var(--p-color-amount, 0.5)` so the user can move from neutral to the variant's full color strategy without regeneration.

```json
{"id":"color-amount","kind":"range","min":0,"max":1,"step":0.05,"default":0.5,"label":"Color amount"}
```

Add at most two variant-specific parameters, such as palette, temperature, or tint behavior. Follow [live.md](live.md)'s parameter contract.

## critique.md
### Purpose

Resolve one stable target, run two independent assessments, synthesize a design critique, persist a snapshot, and ask the user what to improve next. The chat response is the primary deliverable; the snapshot is an archive/backlog for future commands.

### Hard Invariants

- Assessment A (design review) and Assessment B (detector/browser evidence) are both required.
- Assessment A and B MUST run as two isolated sub-agents whenever a sub-agent/Task tool is exposed. Running them inline in this context is "possible" but is NOT permitted; it is a degraded run. Inline is allowed ONLY when no sub-agent tool exists (or the user declined, on harnesses that ask).
- If you degrade for any reason, the report's first line MUST be a banner: `⚠️ DEGRADED: single-context (<reason>)`. A silent degraded critique is a failed critique.
- Assessment A must finish before detector findings enter the parent synthesis context. Detector output is deterministic, but it still anchors judgment.
- A skipped detector is a failed critique run unless `detect.mjs` is missing or crashes after a real attempt.
- Viewable targets require browser inspection when available.
- Any local server started only for critique visualization must run in the background, have a recorded stop method, and be stopped before final reporting unless the user asks to keep it.
- Do not claim a user-visible overlay exists unless script injection succeeded and the detector ran in the page.

### Setup

1. **Resolve the target** to a concrete file path or URL. Prefer a source path over a dev-server URL when both identify the same surface; ports drift, paths do not.
   - "the homepage" -> `site/pages/index.astro` or `index.html`
   - "the settings modal" -> the primary component file
   - "this page" -> the current URL or source file
2. **Confirm the target slugs cleanly**:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/critique-storage.mjs slug "<resolved-path-or-url>"
   ```
   Every later command also accepts the resolved target directly and derives the same slug internally; never hand-write a slug. If this exits non-zero, skip persistence and trend for this run, but continue the critique.
3. **Read `.impeccable/critique/ignore.md`** if it exists. Drop matching findings silently; it is the only prior-run input critique consumes.

### Assessment Orchestration

Delegate Assessment A and Assessment B to separate sub-agents. They must not see each other's output. Do not show findings to the user until synthesis.

Sub-agent gate (all harnesses):
- Unless a harness-specific gate below overrides this, spawn A and B as two isolated, parallel sub-agents whenever a sub-agent/Task tool is exposed. This is the default and is mandatory; do not run them inline because it is faster.
- "Unavailable" means exactly one thing: no sub-agent/Task tool is exposed in this session (or, on harnesses that ask, the user declined). It does not mean inconvenient.
- If and only if sub-agents are unavailable, fall back sequentially: finish and record Assessment A, then run Assessment B, then synthesize, and emit the degraded banner.
- Whichever path you take, declare it in the report header (see Report header provenance). Skipping sub-agents without the banner is the most common failure of this command.

If browser automation is available, each assessment creates its own new tab. Never reuse an existing tab, even if it is already at the right URL.

### Assessment A: Design Review

Read relevant source files and visually inspect the live page when browser automation is available. Think like a design director.

Evaluate:
- **Design specificity**: Is the composition, interaction, and visual language grounded in this product, or could an unrelated product use it unchanged? Make this judgment before seeing detector output.
- **Holistic design**: hierarchy, IA, emotional fit, discoverability, composition, typography, color, accessibility, states, copy, and edge cases.
- **Cognitive load**: consult the [Cognitive Load Assessment](#cognitive-load-assessment) section below; report checklist failures and decision points with >4 visible options.
- **Emotional journey**: peak-end rule, emotional valleys, reassurance at high-stakes moments.
- **Nielsen heuristics**: consult the [Heuristics Scoring Guide](#heuristics-scoring-guide) section below; score all 10 heuristics 0-4, marking any heuristic the mode-applicability rule allows as `n/a` instead of forcing a number.

Return: design-specificity verdict, heuristic scores, cognitive load, emotional journey, 2-3 strengths, 3-5 priority issues, persona red flags, minor observations, and provocative questions.

### Assessment B: Detector + Browser Evidence

Run the bundled detector and browser visualization evidence. Assessment B is mandatory and must remain isolated from Assessment A until both are complete.

CLI scan:
```bash
node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/detect.mjs --json [target]
```

- Pass markup files/directories as `[target]`; do not pass CSS-only files.
- For URLs, skip CLI scan and use browser visualization.
- For very large trees (500+ scannable files), narrow scope or ask.
- Exit code 0 = clean; 2 = findings.
- If the detector entrypoint is missing or fails to load, report deterministic scan unavailable and continue with browser/manual review.

Browser visualization is required for a viewable target when browser automation is available. Use a localhost dev/static URL for local files; avoid `file://` unless the available browser explicitly supports this workflow. Overlay flow:

1. Create a fresh tab and navigate. Prefer the harness's native/browser-canvas screenshot path before hand-rolling a Playwright/Puppeteer script; only fall back to a custom script when no native browser tool is exposed.
2. Preflight mutable injection by setting `document.title` and appending a `<script>` tag. Read-only evaluate APIs do not count.
3. If mutation is unavailable, skip live server, browser presentation, and injection; report fallback signal.
4. If mutation is available, start `node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/live-server.mjs --background`, present the browser if supported, label `[Human]`, scroll top, inject `http://localhost:PORT/detect.js`, wait 2-3 seconds, read `impeccable` console messages, then stop the live server.
5. For multi-view targets, inject on 3-5 representative pages.

Return: CLI findings JSON/counts, browser console findings if applicable, false positives, and skipped/failed browser steps with concrete reasons.

After Assessment B returns usable CLI findings, reuse them. Do not rerun `detect.mjs` in the parent unless Assessment B failed, was truncated, or omitted count, rule names, or file locations.

### Generate Combined Critique Report

Synthesize both assessments into a single report. Do NOT simply concatenate. Weave the findings together, noting where the LLM review and detector agree, where the detector caught issues the LLM missed, and where detector findings are false positives.

The chat response is the primary user-facing deliverable. Present the full structured critique below in chat; do not replace it with a summary and a link. The persisted snapshot is only an archive/backlog for later commands.

Structure your feedback as a design director would:

#### Report header provenance

The report's first line MUST declare how the assessments were run, so a degraded run is never silent:
- Dual-agent: `Method: dual-agent (A: <agent-id> · B: <agent-id>)`
- Degraded: `⚠️ DEGRADED: single-context (<reason, e.g. no sub-agent tool exposed>)`

#### Design Health Score
> *Consult the [Heuristics Scoring Guide](#heuristics-scoring-guide) section below.*

Present the Nielsen's 10 heuristics scores as a table:

| # | Heuristic | Score | Key Issue |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | ? | [specific finding or "n/a" if solid] |
| 2 | Match System / Real World | ? | |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | ? | |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | ? | |
| 5 | Error Prevention | ? | |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | ? | |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency | ? | |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | ? | |
| 9 | Error Recovery | ? | |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | ? | |
| **Total** | | **??/[applicable max]** | **[Rating band]** |

The applicable maximum is 4 times the number of heuristics you actually scored: **/40** when all ten apply, **/32** when two are `n/a`. Never print `/40` over a partial set.

Be honest with scores. A 4 means genuinely excellent. Most real interfaces score 20-32 out of 40.

**Mode applicability**: heuristics 7 (Flexibility and Efficiency) and 10 (Help and Documentation) may be scored `n/a` on Persuade and Experience surfaces (landing pages, campaigns, portfolios, bodies of work), as may any other heuristic that genuinely cannot apply to the surface under review. Write `n/a` in the Score cell with a one-line reason, and renormalize the total to the applicable maximum (e.g. **24/32** when two heuristics are n/a) so the rating band stays proportional. The persisted snapshot must record the applicable maximum and which heuristics were scored n/a.

#### Design Specificity Verdict

**Start here.** Does the result feel authored for this product, or category-interchangeable?

**LLM assessment**: Your unanchored evaluation of design specificity. Cover overall coherence, structural sameness, category-interchangeable choices, and missed opportunities for product character.

**Deterministic scan**: Summarize what the automated detector found, with counts and file locations. Note any additional issues the detector caught that you missed, and flag any false positives.

**Visual overlays** (if injection succeeded): Tell the user that overlays are now visible in the **[Human]** tab in their browser, highlighting the detected issues. Summarize what the console output reported. If browser visualization was attempted but injection failed, say that no reliable user-visible overlay is available and report the fallback signal instead.

#### Overall Impression
A brief gut reaction: what works, what doesn't, and the single biggest opportunity.

#### What's Working
Highlight 2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

#### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance.

For each issue, tag with **P0-P3 severity** (see [Issue Severity below](#issue-severity-p0p3) for definitions):
- **[P?] What**: Name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: How this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: What to do about it (be concrete)
- **Suggested command**: Which command could address this (from: /impeccable adapt, /impeccable animate, /impeccable audit, /impeccable bolder, /impeccable clarify, /impeccable colorize, /impeccable critique, /impeccable delight, /impeccable distill, /impeccable document, /impeccable harden, /impeccable layout, /impeccable onboard, /impeccable optimize, /impeccable overdrive, /impeccable polish, /impeccable quieter, /impeccable shape, /impeccable typeset)

#### Persona Red Flags
> *Consult the [Personas reference](#persona-based-design-testing) below.*

Auto-select 2-3 personas most relevant to this interface type (use the selection table in the reference). If `CLAUDE.md` contains a `## Design Context` section from `impeccable init`, also generate 1-2 project-specific personas from the audience/brand info.

For each selected persona, walk through the primary user action and list specific red flags found:

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard shortcuts detected. Form requires 8 clicks for primary action. Forced modal onboarding. High abandonment risk.

**Jordan (First-Timer)**: Icon-only nav in sidebar. Technical jargon in error messages ("404 Not Found"). No visible help. Will abandon at step 2.

Be specific. Name the exact elements and interactions that fail each persona. Don't write generic persona descriptions; write what broke for them.

#### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

#### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like?"

**Remember**:
- Be direct. Vague feedback wastes everyone's time.
- Be specific. "The submit button," not "some elements."
- Say what's wrong AND why it matters to users.
- Give concrete suggestions. Cut "consider exploring..." entirely.
- Prioritize ruthlessly. If everything is important, nothing is.
- Don't soften criticism. Developers need honest feedback to ship great design.

### Persist the Snapshot

Once the report above is finalized, write it to `.impeccable/critique/` so the user can refer back, and so `/impeccable polish` can pick up the priority issues without a copy-paste.

Skip this step if the Setup slug was null (vague or root-level target).

1. **Write the body to a temp file** so you can pipe it to the helper. Use the full critique report (heuristic table, design-specificity verdict, priority issues, persona red flags, minor observations, and questions), but stop before the "Ask the User" / "Recommended Actions" sections that come later.

2. **Pass the structured metadata** through `IMPECCABLE_CRITIQUE_META` (JSON), then run the write command:
   ```bash
   IMPECCABLE_CRITIQUE_META='{"target":"<user phrasing>","total_score":<n>,"max_score":<n>,"na_heuristics":"<comma-separated numbers, or empty>","p0_count":<n>,"p1_count":<n>}' \
     node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/critique-storage.mjs write "<resolved target>" <body-file>
   ```
   `max_score` is the applicable maximum from the heuristic table (40 when every heuristic applied), so a later run can tell a renormalized total from a full one. The helper prints the absolute path it wrote.

3. **Delete the temp body file** after the write attempt completes, whether the write succeeded or failed. If deletion fails, mention `temp-file cleanup failed: <reason>` briefly in the final output, but do not block the critique.

4. **Read the trend** for context:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/critique-storage.mjs trend "<resolved target>" 5
   ```
   This returns a JSON array of the last 5 frontmatter entries (including the one you just wrote).

5. **Append a single line to the user-visible output**, after the report and before the questions:

   > **Trend for `<slug>` (last 5 runs): 24 → 28 → 32 → 29 → 32 (out of 40)**
   > Wrote `.impeccable/critique/<filename>`.

   Read `max_score` on each trend entry. When every entry shares one maximum, state it once as above. When they differ, print each score with its own denominator (`24/32 → 30/40`) and note that the runs scored different heuristic sets, so the line is not a like-for-like comparison. Treat a missing `max_score` on an older entry as 40.

   If this is the first run for the slug, the trend is just one score; say so: "First run for this target, no trend yet."

This is fire-and-forget. Do not show the user the helper's JSON output; only the human-readable trend line and the written path. Failures here should not block the rest of the flow; print the error and move on.

### Ask the User

**After presenting findings**, use targeted questions based on what was actually found. STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify. These answers will shape the action plan.

Ask questions along these lines (adapt to the specific findings; do NOT ask generic questions):

1. **Priority direction**: Based on the issues found, ask which category matters most to the user right now. For example: "I found problems with visual hierarchy, color usage, and information overload. Which area should we tackle first?" Offer the top 2-3 issue categories as options.

2. **Design intent**: If the critique found a tonal mismatch, ask whether it was intentional. For example: "The interface feels clinical and corporate. Is that the intended tone, or should it feel warmer/bolder/more playful?" Offer 2-3 tonal directions as options based on what would fix the issues found.

3. **Scope**: Ask how much the user wants to take on. For example: "I found N issues. Want to address everything, or focus on the top 3?" Offer scope options like "Top 3 only", "All issues", "Critical issues only".

4. **Constraints** (optional; only ask if relevant): If the findings touch many areas, ask if anything is off-limits. For example: "Should any sections stay as-is?" This prevents the plan from touching things the user considers done.

**Rules for questions**:
- Every question must reference specific findings from the report. Never ask generic "who is your audience?" questions.
- Keep it to 2-4 questions maximum. Respect the user's time.
- Offer concrete options, not open-ended prompts.
- If findings are straightforward (e.g., only 1-2 clear issues), skip questions and go directly to Recommended Actions.

### Recommended Actions

**After receiving the user's answers**, present a prioritized action summary reflecting the user's priorities and scope from Ask the User.

#### Action Summary

List recommended commands in priority order, based on the user's answers:

1. **`/command-name`**: Brief description of what to fix (specific context from critique findings)
2. **`/command-name`**: Brief description (specific context)
...

**Rules for recommendations**:
- Only recommend commands from: /impeccable adapt, /impeccable animate, /impeccable audit, /impeccable bolder, /impeccable clarify, /impeccable colorize, /impeccable critique, /impeccable delight, /impeccable distill, /impeccable document, /impeccable harden, /impeccable layout, /impeccable onboard, /impeccable optimize, /impeccable overdrive, /impeccable polish, /impeccable quieter, /impeccable shape, /impeccable typeset
- Order by the user's stated priorities first, then by impact
- Each item's description should carry enough context that the command knows what to focus on
- Map each Priority Issue to the appropriate command
- Skip commands that would address zero issues
- If the user chose a limited scope, only include items within that scope
- If the user marked areas as off-limits, exclude commands that would touch those areas
- End with `/impeccable polish` as the final step if any fixes were recommended

After presenting the summary, tell the user:

> You can ask me to run these one at a time, all at once, or in any order you prefer.
>
> Re-run `/impeccable critique` after fixes to see your score improve.

## Reference Material

The sections below were previously separate reference files (`cognitive-load.md`, `heuristics-scoring.md`, `personas.md`). They live inline now so the critique flow has all its deep context in one place.

### Cognitive Load Assessment

Cognitive load is the total mental effort required to use an interface. Overloaded users make mistakes, get frustrated, and leave. This reference helps identify and fix cognitive overload.

---

#### Three Types of Cognitive Load

##### Intrinsic Load: The Task Itself
Complexity inherent to what the user is trying to do. You can't eliminate this, but you can structure it.

**Manage it by**:
- Breaking complex tasks into discrete steps
- Providing scaffolding (templates, defaults, examples)
- Progressive disclosure: show what's needed now, hide the rest
- Grouping related decisions together

##### Extraneous Load: Bad Design
Mental effort caused by poor design choices. **Eliminate this ruthlessly.** It's pure waste.

**Common sources**:
- Confusing navigation that requires mental mapping
- Unclear labels that force users to guess meaning
- Visual clutter competing for attention
- Inconsistent patterns that prevent learning
- Unnecessary steps between user intent and result

##### Germane Load: Learning Effort
Mental effort spent building understanding. This is *good* cognitive load; it leads to mastery.

**Support it by**:
- Progressive disclosure that reveals complexity gradually
- Consistent patterns that reward learning
- Feedback that confirms correct understanding
- Onboarding that teaches through action, not walls of text

---

#### Cognitive Load Checklist

Evaluate the interface against these 8 items:

- [ ] **Single focus**: Can the user complete their primary task without distraction from competing elements?
- [ ] **Chunking**: Is information presented in digestible groups (≤4 items per group)?
- [ ] **Grouping**: Are related items visually grouped together (proximity, borders, shared background)?
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy**: Is it immediately clear what's most important on the screen?
- [ ] **One thing at a time**: Can the user focus on a single decision before moving to the next?
- [ ] **Minimal choices**: Are decisions simplified (≤4 visible options at any decision point)?
- [ ] **Working memory**: Does the user need to remember information from a previous screen to act on the current one?
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure**: Is complexity revealed only when the user needs it?

**Scoring**: Count the failed items. 0–1 failures = low cognitive load (good). 2–3 = moderate (address soon). 4+ = high cognitive load (critical fix needed).

---

#### The Working Memory Rule

**Humans can hold ≤4 items in working memory at once** (Miller's Law revised by Cowan, 2001).

At any decision point, count the number of distinct options, actions, or pieces of information a user must simultaneously consider:
- **≤4 items**: Within working memory limits, manageable
- **5–7 items**: Pushing the boundary; consider grouping or progressive disclosure
- **8+ items**: Overloaded; users will skip, misclick, or abandon

**Practical applications**:
- Action buttons: 1 primary, 1–2 secondary, group the rest in a menu
- Navigation menus: ≤5 top-level items (group the rest under clear categories)
- Long-form articles: one reading path; gather related links into a single block at the end instead of scattering them mid-flow
- Documentation sidebars: ≤4 sibling choices visible per level before grouping kicks in
- Portfolio and gallery indexes: one decision per screen (which piece to open), not filter, sort, and tag controls all at once

---

#### Common Cognitive Load Violations

##### 1. The Wall of Options
**Problem**: Presenting 10+ choices at once with no hierarchy.
**Fix**: Group into categories, highlight recommended, use progressive disclosure.

##### 2. The Memory Bridge
**Problem**: User must remember info from step 1 to complete step 3.
**Fix**: Keep relevant context visible, or repeat it where it's needed.

##### 3. The Hidden Navigation
**Problem**: User must build a mental map of where things are.
**Fix**: Always show current location (breadcrumbs, active states, progress indicators).

##### 4. The Jargon Barrier
**Problem**: Technical or domain language forces translation effort.
**Fix**: Use plain language. If domain terms are unavoidable, define them inline.

##### 5. The Visual Noise Floor
**Problem**: Every element has the same visual weight; nothing stands out.
**Fix**: Establish clear hierarchy: one primary element, 2–3 secondary, everything else muted.

##### 6. The Inconsistent Pattern
**Problem**: Similar actions work differently in different places.
**Fix**: Standardize interaction patterns. Same type of action = same type of UI.

##### 7. The Multi-Task Demand
**Problem**: Interface requires processing multiple simultaneous inputs (reading + deciding + navigating).
**Fix**: Sequence the steps. Let the user do one thing at a time.

##### 8. The Context Switch
**Problem**: User must jump between screens/tabs/modals to gather info for a single decision.
**Fix**: Co-locate the information needed for each decision. Reduce back-and-forth.

### Heuristics Scoring Guide

Score each of Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics on a 0–4 scale. Be honest: a 4 means genuinely excellent, not "good enough."

#### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

##### 1. Visibility of System Status

Keep users informed about what's happening through timely, appropriate feedback.

**Check for**:
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Confirmation of user actions (save, submit, delete)
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Current location in navigation (breadcrumbs, active states)
- Form validation feedback (inline, not just on submit)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No feedback; user is guessing what happened |
| 1 | Rare feedback; most actions produce no visible response |
| 2 | Partial; some states communicated, major gaps remain |
| 3 | Good; most operations give clear feedback, minor gaps |
| 4 | Excellent; every action confirms, progress is always visible |

##### 2. Match Between System and Real World

Speak the user's language. Follow real-world conventions. Information appears in natural, logical order.

**Check for**:
- Familiar terminology (no unexplained jargon)
- Logical information order matching user expectations
- Recognizable icons and metaphors
- Domain-appropriate language for the target audience
- Natural reading flow (left-to-right, top-to-bottom priority)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Pure tech jargon, alien to users |
| 1 | Mostly confusing; requires domain expertise to navigate |
| 2 | Mixed; some plain language, some jargon leaks through |
| 3 | Mostly natural; occasional term needs context |
| 4 | Speaks the user's language fluently throughout |

##### 3. User Control and Freedom

Users need a clear "emergency exit" from unwanted states without extended dialogue.

**Check for**:
- Undo/redo functionality
- Cancel buttons on forms and modals
- Clear navigation back to safety (home, previous)
- Easy way to clear filters, search, selections
- Escape from long or multi-step processes

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Users get trapped; no way out without refreshing |
| 1 | Difficult exits; must find obscure paths to escape |
| 2 | Some exits; main flows have escape, edge cases don't |
| 3 | Good control; users can exit and undo most actions |
| 4 | Full control; undo, cancel, back, and escape everywhere |

##### 4. Consistency and Standards

Users shouldn't wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**Check for**:
- Consistent terminology throughout the interface
- Same actions produce same results everywhere
- Platform conventions followed (standard UI patterns)
- Visual consistency (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Consistent interaction patterns (same gesture = same behavior)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Inconsistent everywhere; feels like different products stitched together |
| 1 | Many inconsistencies; similar things look/behave differently |
| 2 | Partially consistent; main flows match, details diverge |
| 3 | Mostly consistent; occasional deviation, nothing confusing |
| 4 | Fully consistent; cohesive system, predictable behavior |

##### 5. Error Prevention

Better than good error messages is a design that prevents problems in the first place.

**Check for**:
- Confirmation before destructive actions (delete, overwrite)
- Constraints preventing invalid input (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Smart defaults that reduce errors
- Clear labels that prevent misunderstanding
- Autosave and draft recovery

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Errors easy to make; no guardrails anywhere |
| 1 | Few safeguards; some inputs validated, most aren't |
| 2 | Partial prevention; common errors caught, edge cases slip |
| 3 | Good prevention; most error paths blocked proactively |
| 4 | Excellent; errors nearly impossible through smart constraints |

##### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimize memory load. Make objects, actions, and options visible or easily retrievable.

**Check for**:
- Visible options (not buried in hidden menus)
- Contextual help when needed (tooltips, inline hints)
- Recent items and history
- Autocomplete and suggestions
- Labels on icons (not icon-only navigation)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Heavy memorization; users must remember paths and commands |
| 1 | Mostly recall; many hidden features, few visible cues |
| 2 | Some aids; main actions visible, secondary features hidden |
| 3 | Good recognition; most things discoverable, few memory demands |
| 4 | Everything discoverable; users never need to memorize |

##### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Accelerators, invisible to novices, speed up expert interaction.

**Check for**:
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Customizable interface elements
- Recent items and favorites
- Bulk/batch actions
- Power user features that don't complicate the basics

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | One rigid path; no shortcuts or alternatives |
| 1 | Limited flexibility; few alternatives to the main path |
| 2 | Some shortcuts; basic keyboard support, limited bulk actions |
| 3 | Good accelerators; keyboard nav, some customization |
| 4 | Highly flexible; multiple paths, power features, customizable |

##### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information. Every element should serve a purpose.

**Check for**:
- Only necessary information visible at each step
- Clear visual hierarchy directing attention
- Purposeful use of color and emphasis
- No decorative clutter competing for attention
- Focused, uncluttered layouts

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Overwhelming; everything competes for attention equally |
| 1 | Cluttered; too much noise, hard to find what matters |
| 2 | Some clutter; main content clear, periphery noisy |
| 3 | Mostly clean; focused design, minor visual noise |
| 4 | Perfectly minimal; every element earns its pixel |

##### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should use plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Check for**:
- Plain language error messages (no error codes for users)
- Specific problem identification ("Email is missing @" not "Invalid input")
- Actionable recovery suggestions
- Errors displayed near the source of the problem
- Non-blocking error handling (don't wipe the form)

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Cryptic errors; codes, jargon, or no message at all |
| 1 | Vague errors; "Something went wrong" with no guidance |
| 2 | Clear but unhelpful; names the problem but not the fix |
| 3 | Clear with suggestions; identifies problem and offers next steps |
| 4 | Perfect recovery; pinpoints issue, suggests fix, preserves user work |

##### 10. Help and Documentation

Even if the system is usable without docs, help should be easy to find, task-focused, and concise.

**Check for**:
- Searchable help or documentation
- Contextual help (tooltips, inline hints, guided tours)
- Task-focused organization (not feature-organized)
- Concise, scannable content
- Easy access without leaving current context

**Scoring**:
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No help available anywhere |
| 1 | Help exists but hard to find or irrelevant |
| 2 | Basic help; FAQ or docs exist, not contextual |
| 3 | Good documentation; searchable, mostly task-focused |
| 4 | Excellent contextual help; right info at the right moment |

---

#### Score Summary

**Total possible**: 40 points (10 heuristics × 4 max)

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 36–40 | Excellent | Minor polish only; ship it |
| 28–35 | Good | Address weak areas, solid foundation |
| 20–27 | Acceptable | Significant improvements needed before users are happy |
| 12–19 | Poor | Major UX overhaul required; core experience broken |
| 0–11 | Critical | Redesign needed; unusable in current state |

When heuristics were scored `n/a`, the maximum is lower than 40; read the band off the percentage instead of the raw number (90%+ Excellent, 70%+ Good, 50%+ Acceptable, 30%+ Poor, below that Critical). 24/32 is 75%, so Good.

---

#### Issue Severity (P0–P3)

Tag each individual issue found during scoring with a priority level:

| Priority | Name | Description | Action |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Blocking | Prevents task completion entirely | Fix immediately; this is a showstopper |
| **P1** | Major | Causes significant difficulty or confusion | Fix before release |
| **P2** | Minor | Annoyance, but workaround exists | Fix in next pass |
| **P3** | Polish | Nice-to-fix, no real user impact | Fix if time permits |

**Tip**: If you're unsure between two levels, ask: "Would a user contact support about this?" If yes, it's at least P1.

---

### Persona-Based Design Testing

Test the interface through the eyes of 5 distinct user archetypes. Each persona exposes different failure modes that a single "design director" perspective would miss.

**How to use**: Select 2–3 personas most relevant to the interface being critiqued. Walk through the primary user action as each persona. Report specific red flags, not generic concerns.

---

#### 1. Impatient Power User: "Alex"

**Profile**: Expert with similar products. Expects efficiency, hates hand-holding. Will find shortcuts or leave.

**Behaviors**:
- Skips all onboarding and instructions
- Looks for keyboard shortcuts immediately
- Tries to bulk-select, batch-edit, and automate
- Gets frustrated by required steps that feel unnecessary
- Abandons if anything feels slow or patronizing

**Test Questions**:
- Can Alex complete the core task in under 60 seconds?
- Are there keyboard shortcuts for common actions?
- Can onboarding be skipped entirely?
- Do modals have keyboard dismiss (Esc)?
- Is there a "power user" path (shortcuts, bulk actions)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Forced tutorials or unskippable onboarding
- No keyboard navigation for primary actions
- Slow animations that can't be skipped
- One-item-at-a-time workflows where batch would be natural
- Redundant confirmation steps for low-risk actions

---

#### 2. Confused First-Timer: "Jordan"

**Profile**: Never used this type of product. Needs guidance at every step. Will abandon rather than figure it out.

**Behaviors**:
- Reads all instructions carefully
- Hesitates before clicking anything unfamiliar
- Looks for help or support constantly
- Misunderstands jargon and abbreviations
- Takes the most literal interpretation of any label

**Test Questions**:
- Is the first action obviously clear within 5 seconds?
- Are all icons labeled with text?
- Is there contextual help at decision points?
- Does terminology assume prior knowledge?
- Is there a clear "back" or "undo" at every step?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Icon-only navigation with no labels
- Technical jargon without explanation
- No visible help option or guidance
- Ambiguous next steps after completing an action
- No confirmation that an action succeeded

---

#### 3. Accessibility-Dependent User: "Sam"

**Profile**: Uses screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA), keyboard-only navigation. May have low vision, motor impairment, or cognitive differences.

**Behaviors**:
- Tabs through the interface linearly
- Relies on ARIA labels and heading structure
- Cannot see hover states or visual-only indicators
- Needs adequate color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- May use browser zoom up to 200%

**Test Questions**:
- Can the entire primary flow be completed keyboard-only?
- Are all interactive elements focusable with visible focus indicators?
- Do images have meaningful alt text?
- Is color contrast WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 for text)?
- Does the screen reader announce state changes (loading, success, errors)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Click-only interactions with no keyboard alternative
- Missing or invisible focus indicators
- Meaning conveyed by color alone (red = error, green = success)
- Unlabeled form fields or buttons
- Time-limited actions without extension option
- Custom components that break screen reader flow

---

#### 4. Deliberate Stress Tester: "Riley"

**Profile**: Methodical user who pushes interfaces beyond the happy path. Tests edge cases, tries unexpected inputs, and probes for gaps in the experience.

**Behaviors**:
- Tests edge cases intentionally (empty states, long strings, special characters)
- Submits forms with unexpected data (emoji, RTL text, very long values)
- Tries to break workflows by navigating backwards, refreshing mid-flow, or opening in multiple tabs
- Looks for inconsistencies between what the UI promises and what actually happens
- Documents problems methodically

**Test Questions**:
- What happens at the edges (0 items, 1000 items, very long text)?
- Do error states recover gracefully or leave the UI in a broken state?
- What happens on refresh mid-workflow? Is state preserved?
- Are there features that appear to work but produce broken results?
- How does the UI handle unexpected input (emoji, special chars, paste from Excel)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Features that appear to work but silently fail or produce wrong results
- Error handling that exposes technical details or leaves UI in a broken state
- Empty states that show nothing useful ("No results" with no guidance)
- Workflows that lose user data on refresh or navigation
- Inconsistent behavior between similar interactions in different parts of the UI

---

#### 5. Distracted Mobile User: "Casey"

**Profile**: Using phone one-handed on the go. Frequently interrupted. Possibly on a slow connection.

**Behaviors**:
- Uses thumb only; prefers bottom-of-screen actions
- Gets interrupted mid-flow and returns later
- Switches between apps frequently
- Has limited attention span and low patience
- Types as little as possible, prefers taps and selections

**Test Questions**:
- Are primary actions in the thumb zone (bottom half of screen)?
- Is state preserved if the user leaves and returns?
- Does it work on slow connections (3G)?
- Can forms use autocomplete and smart defaults?
- Are touch targets at least 44×44pt?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Important actions positioned at the top of the screen (unreachable by thumb)
- No state persistence; progress lost on tab switch or interruption
- Large text inputs required where selection would work
- Heavy assets loading on every page (no lazy loading)
- Tiny tap targets or targets too close together

---

#### Selecting Personas

Choose personas based on the interface type:

| Interface Type | Primary Personas | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Landing page / marketing | Jordan, Riley, Casey | First impressions, trust, mobile |
| Dashboard / admin | Alex, Sam | Power users, accessibility |
| E-commerce / checkout | Casey, Riley, Jordan | Mobile, edge cases, clarity |
| Onboarding flow | Jordan, Casey | Confusion, interruption |
| Data-heavy / analytics | Alex, Sam | Efficiency, keyboard nav |
| Form-heavy / wizard | Jordan, Sam, Casey | Clarity, accessibility, mobile |

---

#### Project-Specific Personas

If `CLAUDE.md` contains a `## Design Context` section (generated by `impeccable init`), derive 1–2 additional personas from the audience and brand information:

1. Read the target audience description
2. Identify the primary user archetype not covered by the 5 predefined personas
3. Create a persona following this template:

```
##### [Role]: "[Name]"

**Profile**: [2-3 key characteristics derived from Design Context]

**Behaviors**: [3-4 specific behaviors based on the described audience]

**Red Flags**: [3-4 things that would alienate this specific user type]
```

Only generate project-specific personas when real Design Context data is available. Don't invent audience details; use the 5 predefined personas when no context exists.

## distill.md
Strip a design to its essence. Remove anything that doesn't earn its place: redundant elements, repeated information, decorative noise, cosmetic complexity.


---

## Assess Current State

Analyze what makes the design feel complex or cluttered:

1. **Identify complexity sources**:
   - **Too many elements**: Competing buttons, redundant information, visual clutter
   - **Excessive variation**: Too many colors, fonts, sizes, styles without purpose
   - **Information overload**: Everything visible at once, no progressive disclosure
   - **Visual noise**: Unnecessary borders, shadows, backgrounds, decorations
   - **Confusing hierarchy**: Unclear what matters most
   - **Feature creep**: Too many options, actions, or paths forward

2. **Find the essence**:
   - What's the primary user goal? (There should be ONE)
   - What's actually necessary vs nice-to-have?
   - What can be removed, hidden, or combined?
   - What's the 20% that delivers 80% of value?

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify.

**CRITICAL**: Simplicity is not about removing features. It's about removing obstacles between users and their goals. Every element should justify its existence.

## Plan Simplification

Create a ruthless editing strategy:

- **Core purpose**: What's the ONE thing this should accomplish?
- **Essential elements**: What's truly necessary to achieve that purpose?
- **Progressive disclosure**: What can be hidden until needed?
- **Consolidation opportunities**: What can be combined or integrated?

**IMPORTANT**: Simplification is hard. It requires saying no to good ideas to make room for great execution. Be ruthless.

## Simplify the Design

Systematically remove complexity across these dimensions:

### Information Architecture
- **Reduce scope**: Remove secondary actions, optional features, redundant information
- **Progressive disclosure**: Hide complexity behind clear entry points (accordions, modals, step-through flows)
- **Combine related actions**: Merge similar buttons, consolidate forms, group related content
- **Clear hierarchy**: ONE primary action, few secondary actions, everything else tertiary or hidden
- **Remove redundancy**: If it's said elsewhere, don't repeat it here

### Visual Simplification
- **Reduce color palette**: Use 1-2 colors plus neutrals, not 5-7 colors
- **Limit typography**: One font family, 3-4 sizes maximum, 2-3 weights
- **Remove decorations**: Eliminate borders, shadows, backgrounds that don't serve hierarchy or function
- **Flatten structure**: Reduce nesting, remove unnecessary containers; never nest cards inside cards
- **Remove unnecessary cards**: Cards aren't needed for basic layout; use spacing and alignment instead
- **Consistent spacing**: Use one spacing scale, remove arbitrary gaps

### Layout Simplification
- **Linear flow**: Replace complex grids with simple vertical flow where possible
- **Remove sidebars**: Move secondary content inline or hide it
- **Full-width**: Use available space generously instead of complex multi-column layouts
- **Consistent alignment**: Pick left or center, stick with it
- **Generous white space**: Let content breathe, don't pack everything tight

### Interaction Simplification
- **Reduce choices**: Fewer buttons, fewer options, clearer path forward (paradox of choice is real)
- **Smart defaults**: Make common choices automatic, only ask when necessary
- **Inline actions**: Replace modal flows with inline editing where possible
- **Remove steps**: Can the flow lose a step?
- **Clear next action**: ONE obvious next action, not five competing ones

### Content Simplification
- **Shorter copy**: Cut every sentence in half, then do it again
- **Active voice**: "Save changes" not "Changes will be saved"
- **Remove jargon**: Plain language always wins
- **Scannable structure**: Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headings
- **Essential information only**: Remove marketing fluff, legalese, hedging
- **Remove redundant copy**: No headers restating intros, no repeated explanations, say it once

### Code Simplification
- **Remove unused code**: Dead CSS, unused components, orphaned files
- **Flatten component trees**: Reduce nesting depth
- **Consolidate styles**: Merge similar styles, use utilities consistently
- **Reduce variants**: Does that component need 12 variations, or can 3 cover 90% of cases?

**NEVER**:
- Remove necessary functionality (simplicity ≠ feature-less)
- Sacrifice accessibility for simplicity (clear labels and ARIA still required)
- Make things so simple they're unclear (mystery ≠ minimalism)
- Remove information users need to make decisions
- Eliminate hierarchy completely (some things should stand out)
- Oversimplify complex domains (match complexity to actual task complexity)

## Verify Simplification

Ensure simplification improves usability:

- **Faster task completion**: Can users accomplish goals more quickly?
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Is it easier to understand what to do?
- **Still complete**: Are all necessary features still accessible?
- **Clearer hierarchy**: Is it obvious what matters most?
- **Better performance**: Does simpler design load faster?

## Document Removed Complexity

If you removed features or options:
- Document why they were removed
- Consider if they need alternative access points
- Note any user feedback to monitor

When the cuts feel right, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass. As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry put it: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

## craft-floor.md
# Craft floor

Load this after the direction is settled, and build without announcing the checklist. A pinned brief or the committed visual world overrides anything here; your own habit does not. When the design hook is active it already enforces the mechanical checks below as you edit: act on its findings instead of re-auditing each rule.

## Verify

Each of these is a check on the built result, not an intention. Run them together in the batched inspection rounds, not as separate screenshot trips; the checks share one render.

- **Contrast:** body and placeholder text ≥4.5:1, large text ≥3:1. On colored surfaces tint secondary text from that hue or the foreground; never gray.
- **Depth:** shadows carry an offset and a soft blur. A zero-offset colored halo is decoration.
- **Spacing:** tight groups, generous separation, more space above a heading than below it. Read the computed values.
- **Type:** body measure 65–75ch, display max 6rem, tracking floor -0.04em, balanced headings, obvious scale and weight steps. Run the real copy at every breakpoint and fix what overflows.
- **Motion:** one authored moment, not scattered effects and not one identical entrance on every section. Exponential ease-out from an already-visible default. Reach past transform and opacity: blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask, and shadow belong to the palette when they stay smooth.
- **States:** hover, disabled, loading, error, empty. Plus real content, working controls, responsive composition, keyboard focus.
- **Browser surfaces:** the parts you did not draw still carry the design. Text selection, the caret, custom scrollbars, focus rings, underline offset, and the numerals in tabular data all ship with browser defaults that belong to no design system. Theme them from the palette. This is the cheapest signal that a page was built rather than assembled, and the one models skip most reliably.
- **Copy:** the product's own language. Controls name their action; errors name the problem and the recovery.
- **Coverage:** every brief requirement present and findable within seconds.

## Refuse

These are the category's defaults, not bans: the brief's own words can earn any of them. Reaching for one when the axis is free means you were not deciding; recognizing that means rewriting the element, not softening it.

Page scaffolds:

- Same-size cards of icon plus heading plus text as the page structure. Cards are the lazy container; nested cards are always wrong.
- The hero-metric template: big number, small label, supporting stats, accent.
- A kicker or eyebrow above a heading. This one is a ban, not a default: no brief earns it back. The heading carries its own weight; delete the label and let the heading speak.
- Section numbers (01 / 02 / 03) unless the sequence itself carries information the reader needs.
- A modal for a task that needs neither interruption nor protected focus.

Surface habits:

- Gradient text. Emphasis comes from weight or size.
- Glass and blur as decoration rather than as a specific effect.
- A colored `border-left` or `border-right` above 1px on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts.
- Hard offset shadows (`box-shadow: 4px 4px 0`) outside a world that is actually neobrutalist. The zero-blur block shadow is a costume, not a depth system; a world that did not choose it never earns it as a default.
- Sparklines, progress rings, and soft-shadowed rounded rectangles standing in for content.
- Monospace as a costume for "technical" rather than for code, data, or measurement.
- A system display face (Impact, Arial Black, the platform sans) as the display voice of an own-world page. Source and self-host a face whose character matches the approved lettering; the closest installed font is a failure, not a fallback.
- Unicode glyphs or emoji standing in for an icon system. Icons are drawn, from a real library or authored SVG, in one consistent stroke and weight.
- Light or dark picked by category. Pick it from the use scene: who, where, under what ambient light.

The floor holds the mechanics; it never picks the direction. With every check green, spend the page on the committed world, and when torn between refined and committed, commit.

## adapt.md
> **Additional context needed**: target platforms/devices and usage contexts.

Adapt an existing design to a different context: another screen size, device, platform, or use case. The trap is treating adaptation as scaling. The job is rethinking the experience for the new context.

**Web only** (mobile web included). Native platforms (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`) route to [adapt.native.md](adapt.native.md) instead; if the project is native, switch to it now.

---

## Assess Adaptation Challenge

Understand what needs adaptation and why:

1. **Identify the source context**:
   - What was it designed for originally? (Desktop web? Mobile app?)
   - What assumptions were made? (Large screen? Mouse input? Fast connection?)
   - What works well in current context?

2. **Understand target context**:
   - **Device**: Mobile, tablet, desktop, TV, watch, print?
   - **Input method**: Touch, mouse, keyboard, voice, gamepad?
   - **Screen constraints**: Size, resolution, orientation?
   - **Connection**: Fast wifi, slow 3G, offline?
   - **Usage context**: On-the-go vs desk, quick glance vs focused reading?
   - **User expectations**: What do users expect on this platform?

3. **Identify adaptation challenges**:
   - What won't fit? (Content, navigation, features)
   - What won't work? (Hover states on touch, tiny touch targets)
   - What's inappropriate? (Desktop patterns on mobile, mobile patterns on desktop)

**CRITICAL**: Adaptation is rethinking the experience for the new context, not scaling pixels.

## Plan Adaptation Strategy

Create context-appropriate strategy:

### Mobile Adaptation (Desktop → Mobile)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Single column instead of multi-column
- Vertical stacking instead of side-by-side
- Full-width components instead of fixed widths
- Bottom navigation instead of top/side navigation

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Touch targets 44x44px minimum (not hover-dependent)
- Swipe gestures where appropriate (lists, carousels)
- Bottom sheets instead of dropdowns
- Thumbs-first design (controls within thumb reach)
- Larger tap areas with more spacing

**Content Strategy**:
- Progressive disclosure (don't show everything at once)
- Prioritize primary content (secondary content in tabs/accordions)
- Shorter text (more concise)
- Larger text (16px minimum)

**Navigation Strategy**:
- Hamburger menu or bottom navigation
- Reduce navigation complexity
- Sticky headers for context
- Back button in navigation flow

### Tablet Adaptation (Hybrid Approach)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Two-column layouts (not single or three-column)
- Side panels for secondary content
- Master-detail views (list + detail)
- Adaptive based on orientation (portrait vs landscape)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Support both touch and pointer
- Touch targets 44x44px but allow denser layouts than phone
- Side navigation drawers
- Multi-column forms where appropriate

### Desktop Adaptation (Mobile → Desktop)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Multi-column layouts (use horizontal space)
- Side navigation always visible
- Multiple information panels simultaneously
- Fixed widths with max-width constraints (don't stretch to 4K)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Hover states for additional information
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Right-click context menus
- Drag and drop where helpful
- Multi-select with Shift/Cmd

**Content Strategy**:
- Show more information upfront (less progressive disclosure)
- Data tables with many columns
- Richer visualizations
- More detailed descriptions

### Print Adaptation (Screen → Print)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Page breaks at logical points
- Remove navigation, footer, interactive elements
- Black and white (or limited color)
- Proper margins for binding

**Content Strategy**:
- Expand shortened content (show full URLs, hidden sections)
- Add page numbers, headers, footers
- Include metadata (print date, page title)
- Convert charts to print-friendly versions

### Email Adaptation (Web → Email)

**Layout Strategy**:
- Narrow width (600px max)
- Single column only
- Inline CSS (no external stylesheets)
- Table-based layouts (for email client compatibility)

**Interaction Strategy**:
- Large, obvious CTAs (buttons not text links)
- No hover states (not reliable)
- Deep links to web app for complex interactions

## Implement Adaptations

Apply changes systematically:

### Responsive Breakpoints

Choose appropriate breakpoints:
- Mobile: 320px-767px
- Tablet: 768px-1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Or content-driven breakpoints (where design breaks)

### Layout Adaptation Techniques

- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Reflow layouts automatically
- **Container Queries**: Adapt based on container, not viewport
- **`clamp()`**: Fluid sizing between min and max
- **Media queries**: Different styles for different contexts
- **Display properties**: Show/hide elements per context

### Touch Adaptation

- Increase touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
- Add more spacing between interactive elements
- Remove hover-dependent interactions
- Add touch feedback (ripples, highlights)
- Consider thumb zones (easier to reach bottom than top)

### Content Adaptation

- Use `display: none` sparingly (still downloads)
- Progressive enhancement (core content first, enhancements on larger screens)
- Lazy loading for off-screen content
- Responsive images (`srcset`, `picture` element)

### Navigation Adaptation

- Transform complex nav to hamburger/drawer on mobile
- Bottom nav bar for mobile apps
- Persistent side navigation on desktop
- Breadcrumbs on smaller screens for context

**IMPORTANT**: Test on real devices. Device emulation in DevTools is helpful but not perfect.

**NEVER**:
- Hide core functionality on mobile (if it matters, make it work)
- Assume desktop = powerful device (consider accessibility, older machines)
- Use different information architecture across contexts (confusing)
- Break user expectations for platform (mobile users expect mobile patterns)
- Forget landscape orientation on mobile/tablet
- Use generic breakpoints blindly (use content-driven breakpoints)
- Ignore touch on desktop (many desktop devices have touch)

## Verify Adaptations

Test thoroughly across contexts:

- **Real devices**: Test on actual phones, tablets, desktops
- **Different orientations**: Portrait and landscape
- **Different browsers**: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Different OS**: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
- **Different input methods**: Touch, mouse, keyboard
- **Edge cases**: Very small screens (320px), very large screens (4K)
- **Slow connections**: Test on throttled network

When the adaptation feels native to each context, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## Reference Material

The sections below were previously `responsive-design.md` and live inline now so the adapt flow has its deep responsive reference in one place.

### Responsive Design

#### Mobile-First: Write It Right

Start with base styles for mobile, use `min-width` queries to layer complexity. Desktop-first (`max-width`) means mobile loads unnecessary styles first.

#### Breakpoints: Content-Driven

Don't chase device sizes; let content tell you where to break. Start narrow, stretch until design breaks, add breakpoint there. Three breakpoints usually suffice (640, 768, 1024px). Use `clamp()` for fluid values without breakpoints.

#### Detect Input Method, Not Just Screen Size

**Screen size doesn't tell you input method.** A laptop with touchscreen, a tablet with keyboard. Use pointer and hover queries:

```css
/* Fine pointer (mouse, trackpad) */
@media (pointer: fine) {
  .button { padding: 8px 16px; }
}

/* Coarse pointer (touch, stylus) */
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .button { padding: 12px 20px; }  /* Larger touch target */
}

/* Device supports hover */
@media (hover: hover) {
  .card:hover { transform: translateY(-2px); }
}

/* Device doesn't support hover (touch) */
@media (hover: none) {
  .card { /* No hover state - use active instead */ }
}
```

**Critical**: Don't rely on hover for functionality. Touch users can't hover.

#### Safe Areas: Handle the Notch

Modern phones have notches, rounded corners, and home indicators. Use `env()`:

```css
body {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);
  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);
}

/* With fallback */
.footer {
  padding-bottom: max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
}
```

**Enable viewport-fit** in your meta tag:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

#### Responsive Images: Get It Right

##### srcset with Width Descriptors

```html
<img
  src="hero-800.jpg"
  srcset="
    hero-400.jpg 400w,
    hero-800.jpg 800w,
    hero-1200.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
  alt="Hero image"
>
```

**How it works**:
- `srcset` lists available images with their actual widths (`w` descriptors)
- `sizes` tells the browser how wide the image will display
- Browser picks the best file based on viewport width AND device pixel ratio

##### Picture Element for Art Direction

When you need different crops/compositions (not just resolutions):

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="wide.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="tall.jpg">
  <img src="fallback.jpg" alt="...">
</picture>
```

#### Layout Adaptation Patterns

**Navigation**: Three stages: hamburger + drawer on mobile, horizontal compact on tablet, full with labels on desktop. **Tables**: Transform to cards on mobile using `display: block` and `data-label` attributes. **Progressive disclosure**: Use `<details>/<summary>` for content that can collapse on mobile.

#### Testing: Don't Trust DevTools Alone

DevTools device emulation is useful for layout but misses:

- Actual touch interactions
- Real CPU/memory constraints
- Network latency patterns
- Font rendering differences
- Browser chrome/keyboard appearances

**Test on at least**: One real iPhone, one real Android, a tablet if relevant. Cheap Android phones reveal performance issues you'll never see on simulators.

---

**Avoid**: Desktop-first design. Device detection instead of feature detection. Separate mobile/desktop codebases. Ignoring tablet and landscape. Assuming all mobile devices are powerful.

## delight.md
> **Additional context needed**: the brand's emotional range.

Make the experience memorable at moments that earn it. Delight is not a layer of generic whimsy; it is product character revealed through a useful interaction, a humane response, or an unexpectedly considered detail.

---

## Visitor mode

- **Persuade + Experience:** personality may run through voice, composition, motion, and discovery, provided the artifact remains the focus.
- **Operate + Read:** concentrate delight at meaningful moments such as first use, completion, recovery, or mastery. Reliability carries everything else.

## Find the opportunity

Inspect the target, DESIGN.md, product voice, repeated-use frequency, and emotional context. Look for:

- effort worth acknowledging;
- waiting that can become informative;
- an empty or first-use state that can orient;
- an error or recovery moment that needs empathy;
- an interaction whose physical or verbal response could express the brand;
- a useful capability people might enjoy discovering.

Do not manufacture a celebration for an ordinary click. Ask only when the brand's emotional range or the stakes cannot be inferred.

## Define one delight thesis

State in one sentence what the user should feel and why that feeling belongs to this product. Then choose the smallest system that can deliver it:

- a distinctive response to a meaningful action;
- product-specific language that clarifies while carrying voice;
- an interaction or transition with a recognizable material behavior;
- an illustration, sound, haptic, or environmental detail grounded in the product world;
- a discovery reward that reveals real utility.

Derive the treatment from product mechanism and visual world, not a stock catalog.

## Build for the emotional moment

- **Success:** match the response to the effort and consequence. Major milestones can expand; routine saves should simply feel certain.
- **Waiting:** show truthful progress, useful context, or product-specific activity. Never fake work or delay completion to stage a flourish.
- **Empty and first use:** make the next action clear before adding personality.
- **Error and recovery:** lead with the problem and recovery. Warmth may reduce stress; jokes must not trivialize loss, money, privacy, or blocked work.
- **Repeated interaction:** keep the response satisfying after the hundredth use. Variation is useful only when it remains coherent and predictable enough to trust.
- **Discovery:** reward curiosity without hiding required functionality.

Copy must use the product's language. Generic whimsy is worse than neutral clarity.

## Protect the experience

Delight must not:

- delay, block, or obscure the primary task;
- override platform conventions or accessibility;
- add unrequested factual claims;
- play sound without consent or ignore mute settings;
- become mandatory, unskippable, or exhausting on repeat;
- add a dependency or asset cost disproportionate to the moment.

For authored motion, load [animate.md](animate.md). Respect screen readers, keyboard use, touch, localization, and cultural context. Nonessential loops stop when hidden. Make celebration intensity proportional to frequency and consequence.

## Verify

- The moment is specific enough that a neighboring product could not use it unchanged.
- It improves comprehension, confidence, motivation, or emotional recovery.
- The interface remains fast and obvious without the flourish.
- Repetition does not turn charm into friction.
- Muted, keyboard, touch, and localized paths work.
- The result feels like the selected world, not a generic “delight” treatment.

When the personality feels earned, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## doctor.md
Report and repair drift between this project's Impeccable artifacts and what the installed version reads: PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md and its `.impeccable/design.json` sidecar, `.impeccable/config.json`, persisted surface briefs, and the design hook.

This is maintenance, not design. Do not redesign anything, do not open files outside the ones the report names, and do not run any other command as a side effect.

## What this owns, and what it does not

Three kinds of drift travel under "out of date". Keep them apart:

- **Tool version.** The installed skill is older than the published one. `context.mjs` reports that at boot as `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` and `npx impeccable update` fixes it. Not this command's job.
- **Schema drift.** An artifact was written by an older Impeccable: fields nothing reads, fields now expected, files in retired locations. Mechanical, and this command repairs most of it.
- **Truth drift.** The code moved on and the document no longer describes it. No file comparison settles this. `document` owns DESIGN.md, `init` owns PRODUCT.md, and this command's job is to hand them a specific gap rather than a vague suspicion.

## Step 1: Run the pass

```
node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/doctor.mjs --json
```

Add `--target <path>` when the user named a workspace, file, or route in a monorepo. Without it the report describes the repo root, and in a monorepo that is often the wrong project.

The output carries `findings` (each with `id`, `artifact`, `path`, `severity`, `summary`, `fix`) and, in a monorepo, `workspaces` with each app's product and design resolution. `ruleRegistryAvailable: false` means ignored rule ids could not be validated; say so rather than implying that list is clean.

An empty `findings` array is the good outcome. Say so in one line and stop.

## Step 2: Act by severity

The severity says what should happen, not how bad it is.

- **`auto`** carries no decision. Run `node .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/doctor.mjs --fix` once to apply these, then report what it moved in one line. Do not ask permission first, and do not ask about them afterward.
- **`mention`** needs the user to know but not to decide anything now. State each one in a sentence with its offered fix.
- **`route`** needs a specific command. Name the command and the gap it would close. Run it only if the user asks in this turn; `init` and `document` are conversations, not repairs you perform unattended.

Report all three groups in one pass. Findings are not errors and the command does not fail on them.

## Step 3: Deprecated fields are binding

A finding that reports a deprecated field (`## Register` is the current one) is not a style note. Treat that field as absent for every decision from here on, whatever value it holds, and offer to delete the section. Preserving it "just in case" is how a retired axis keeps steering current output.

## Step 4: Do not overclaim on truth drift

`design-md-drift` counts commits to the visual source directories since DESIGN.md was last edited. A commit count is not a contradiction. Report the number, say what it measures, and if the user wants to know whether the document is actually wrong, read DESIGN.md against the current tokens and components and answer from that. Never assert that DESIGN.md is stale because the number is large.

The same restraint applies to `workspace-context-inherited`. Inheritance is a designed behavior. Whether one product record truthfully describes several apps is a question for the user, not a defect to fix.

## Monorepo notes

- `workspace-platform-native-evidence` is the finding that matters most here: a workspace carrying native build files while inheriting a root record that resolves to web gets web guidance for its whole life and never loads [ios.md](ios.md) or [android.md](android.md). The repair is a child PRODUCT.md in that workspace, because one inherited record cannot hold two platforms.
- `config-project-roots-match-nothing` means every `projectRoots` glob missed, so the repo root is silently standing in as the active project. A renamed workspace directory is the usual cause. Report the patterns and ask which directories they should name.
- Use the `workspaces` table to show the user which apps carry their own context, which inherit, and which have none, before proposing any change.

## Opting out of the boot check

`context.mjs` reports the cheap subset of these findings at session start, throttled to once a week per project. Set `"stalenessCheck": false` in `.impeccable/config.json` to silence that, or `IMPECCABLE_NO_STALENESS_CHECK=1` for one session. This command still works with the check disabled, and that is the combination to suggest for a user who wants the report only when they ask for it.

## bolder.md
> **Additional context needed**: which section is the target, and what must stay untouched.

"Bolder" is an amplification request, and almost always it is scoped to something that already exists. The surrounding page, its system, and its conventions are the given. Your job is to raise one part to the conviction the rest already implies, without rebuilding anything the brief did not name. The reflex answer, reaching for more effects, is the opposite of bold; reject it first.

## Scope is sovereign

"Everything else stays" is a literal instruction. Touch only the named target. Do not restyle its neighbors, do not migrate the page to a new idea, do not add colors, fonts, radii, shadows, or system primitives the surface does not already own. If the existing system genuinely cannot express the direction, stop and STOP and call the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify. before expanding it, naming the exact addition and the job it would do.

## Why it reads flat

A section usually reads flat for reasons its neighbors have already solved. Look at what the rest of the page does that this section does not: the display type at full strength, the structural devices that carry meaning, the signature motif, the density and pacing. A flat section is typically one that quietly opts out of the system's own strongest moves. The most reliable bolder pass brings the target up to the expressive level its neighbors already reach, in the system's own vocabulary rather than a new one.

## The amplification

- **Amplify what the system already owns.** Reuse its motif and its type scale at full strength, turned up for this section rather than invented for it. The bolder version should look more like the same brand, not less.
- **Keep content true.** Existing claims are part of the scope: preserve them unless the user supplies replacements. If real evidence is essential to the direction but absent, ask for it.
- **Commit, then clarify.** Half-measures read as noise. Make the one decisive move completely, then quiet everything around it so the move is legible. If every element got louder, the section got flatter.
- **Give it its own rhythm.** The target should read as a peak in the scroll, a shift in density or pace from what surrounds it, not simply more of the same.

## The skeleton test

Strip the copy out of your planned section and study the bare structure. Does the skeleton still say what this section is and why it matters, through hierarchy and the system's devices alone? If it only works once the words return, the boldness is in the text size, not the design. A placeholder for an image or artifact names a job, an anchor and a piece of evidence, not a cue to drop in a decorative photo; fill that job with whatever the subject actually has.

## Before you finish

- Everything outside the named target is unchanged.
- No new color, font, or system primitive appeared without being asked for.
- The conventions the section carried, including anything that drives an action, still work the same way.
- The section is unmistakably the same brand, only more sure of itself.

When the target holds its own without pulling the page apart, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## clarify.md
> **Additional context needed**: audience knowledge and emotional state.

Rewrite unclear interface text so users understand what happened, what matters, and what to do next. Preserve factual meaning, product terminology, and brand voice.

## Audit the language

Read the entire interaction path, not isolated strings. Identify:

- ambiguous nouns, verbs, and actions;
- internal jargon or assumed knowledge;
- vague labels, outcomes, and system states;
- missing consequences, recovery, or timing;
- inconsistent terminology and capitalization;
- redundant headings, intros, helper text, and confirmations;
- text that breaks at realistic widths or in translation;
- tone that ignores stress, risk, success, or urgency.

Infer audience and task from product context and surrounding UI. Ask before changing factual claims, legal meaning, or a term that may be domain-specific.

## Set the message hierarchy

For each state, decide:

1. the one fact the user needs now;
2. the action available next;
3. supporting context that changes the decision;
4. the appropriate tone for this moment.

Say each idea once. If the heading already explains the state, the introduction should add new information or disappear.

## Rewrite by function

### Actions and navigation

Use a specific verb and object when the outcome is not already obvious. Labels should describe what will happen, not the gesture used to trigger it. Keep the same noun and verb for the same concept throughout the product.

For destructive actions, name the object and consequence. Prefer undo over confirmation when recovery is safe. When confirmation is necessary, name the action on both the message and button instead of using `Yes`, `No`, `OK`, or `Submit`.

### Forms

Use persistent labels; placeholders are examples, not labels. Put format and eligibility requirements before submission. Explain why information is requested only when it is not obvious. Required and optional treatment should be consistent.

Validation says what needs attention and how to correct it without blaming the user. Keep related instructions near the field and announce errors accessibly.

### Errors and permissions

An actionable error answers:

1. what failed;
2. why, when known and useful;
3. how to recover or what alternative remains.

Do not expose internal codes as the primary message. Do not promise a cause or resolution the system cannot know. Treat privacy, payment, deletion, access loss, and blocked work seriously; warmth is welcome, jokes are not.

### Loading, empty, and success states

Loading text names the real operation and sets an honest expectation when the wait is meaningful. Show determinate progress when available; never invent progress.

An empty state distinguishes first use, no results, filters, permissions, and failure. Explain the state and provide the next useful action.

Success confirms the completed outcome and mentions the next consequence only when it changes what the user should do. Routine success should be brief.

### Help and instructional text

Helper text answers an implicit question instead of restating the control. Use progressive disclosure for uncommon detail. Link text must make sense out of context; icon-only controls need accessible names.

## Voice, accessibility, and localization

Voice stays consistent; tone adapts to the moment. Use plain language without flattening terminology the audience genuinely knows.

- Write complete translatable messages rather than concatenated fragments.
- Keep variables and numbers structured so translators can reorder them.
- Allow expansion instead of abbreviating prematurely.
- Make alt text convey the image's information; use empty alt for decoration.
- Keep screen-reader names aligned with visible labels and outcomes.
- Do not rely on punctuation, color, or iconography to carry the message alone.

Maintain a short terminology glossary when inconsistency spans the product. Do not vary words for literary effect in an interface.

## Verify

Read the flow in context and test:

- comprehension without hidden product knowledge;
- actionability at errors, empty states, and decision points;
- factual accuracy and consistent terminology;
- scanability at target widths and 200% zoom;
- long names, localization expansion, pluralization, and dynamic values;
- accessible names and announced state changes;
- tone appropriate to consequence and emotional context.

The final copy is as short as it can be without removing meaning or recovery.

When the language reads cleanly, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## animate.md
> **Additional context needed**: performance constraints.

Use motion to explain state, relationship, and hierarchy, or to create one authored moment the surface has earned. Decoration without purpose is animation debt.

---

## Visitor mode

- **Persuade + Experience:** motion may carry the voice. Prefer one rehearsed focal sequence to repeated section reveals.
- **Operate + Read:** motion serves feedback, state, and continuity. Keep routine transitions fast and do not make users wait through page-load choreography.
- **Native (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`):** follow the Motion section of [ios.md](ios.md) or [android.md](android.md), including the platform's Reduce Motion behavior. Do not apply the web tooling below.

## Find the job

Inspect the existing motion language, interaction states, target devices, and performance budget. Find only the places where motion would:

- acknowledge an action;
- make a state change or spatial relationship legible;
- preserve continuity through navigation or layout change;
- direct attention at a meaningful moment;
- embody the selected visual world.

Ask only when a material constraint cannot be inferred. Do not animate a static area merely because it exists.

## Set the motion thesis

Write a short plan before implementation:

- **Focal moment:** the one sequence or interaction that deserves authorship, if any.
- **Continuity:** the state, layout, or navigation changes that need explanation.
- **Feedback:** the controls and outcomes that need acknowledgment.
- **Budget:** which effects may be expensive and how often they run.

The focal moment must come from this product and surface concept. A generic fade-and-rise, hover lift, parallax layer, or scroll reveal is not a thesis.

## Choose material by meaning

Transform and opacity are reliable foundations, not the entire palette. Choose properties for what the transition communicates:

- **Continuity and relationship:** shared-element motion, FLIP-style transforms, view transitions, or deliberate spatial movement.
- **Focus and depth:** bounded blur, filter, backdrop, light, or shadow changes.
- **Reveal and composition:** masks, clip paths, cropping, or controlled occlusion.
- **Material and energy:** color, gradient position, texture, distortion, or shader effects when the world and runtime support them.
- **State and feedback:** the smallest change that makes cause and result unmistakable.

Do not stack techniques for spectacle. One strong material idea, carried through the focal sequence and quiet supporting states, is usually enough.

Sibling stagger is appropriate when a list appears as a list. Cap the total delay, and never reinterpret every scrolled section as a staggered list.

## Timing and easing

Timing should express distance and consequence:

| Duration | Typical use |
|---|---|
| 100–150 ms | immediate feedback |
| 150–300 ms | routine state change |
| 300–500 ms | layout, overlay, or view transition |
| 500–800 ms | a deliberately authored focal entrance |

Exit faster than entrance. Use natural deceleration such as `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` for confident arrivals; do not use bounce or elastic curves by reflex. Long feedback feels like latency.

## Implement to the runtime

- Use CSS transitions and keyframes for declarative state and bounded sequences.
- Use Web Animations API or the project's existing motion library for interruption, sequencing, and dynamic values.
- Use View Transitions or shared-element techniques when continuity across states is the point.
- Use scroll-driven motion only when the scroll relationship itself carries meaning, with a robust fallback.
- Do not add a dependency for an effect the existing stack can express cleanly.

Keep content visible in the default state so failed scripts do not hide the page. Avoid casually animating layout-driving properties such as `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, and margins; use FLIP, transforms, or grid techniques when appropriate. Bound blur, filter, shadow, canvas, and shader work to isolated regions. Apply `will-change` only during known animation. Measure on target viewports and devices rather than assuming transform means fast.

## Accessibility and control

Respect autoplay and sound preferences. Any nonessential loop must stop when offscreen or hidden.

## Verify

- The focal motion is specific to the selected world and surface.
- Every supporting animation explains feedback, state, or relationship.
- Interruption and repeated use behave correctly.
- Desktop, mobile, and keyboard paths remain usable.
- Expensive effects stay smooth on the target device.
- Removing an animation would lose meaning or authored character, not merely decoration.

When motion earns its place, hand off to `/impeccable polish` for the final pass.
